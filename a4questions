For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 32768 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

cache1D
-------

Describe how you tested your code to verify that it works.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

Which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?

Which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
  size affect the hit ratio for this program?

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for these 2 programs.
Justify your statistics.

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for these 2 programs.
Explain any differences.
