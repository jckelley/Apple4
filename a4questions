For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 32768 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

cache1D
-------

Describe how you tested your code to verify that it works.

    We created a line of test code that printed out the contents of the array.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

    Instruction cache misses:   5810
    Instruction cache references:   10099999
    Data cache misses:      2007535
    Data cache references:      10049263

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

    0.0005752475817076813

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

    0.1997693761224082

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

    Instruction cache misses:   1104
    Instruction cache references:   10099999
    Data cache misses:      257263
    Data cache references:      10049263

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

    0.00010930694151553876

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

    0.025600185804670453

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

    Instruction cache misses:   651
    Instruction cache references:   10099999
    Data cache misses:      134312
    Data cache references:      10049263

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

    6.445545192628237e-05

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

    0.013365358235723357

Which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?

    64 bytes, it had a smaller ratio, which meant that misses were less frequent. Less frequent misses implies that there was less CPU logic and power consumption, thus it was more efficient.



Which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
  size affect the hit ratio for this program?

    64 bytes, it had a smaller ratio, which meant that misses were less frequent. Less frequent misses implies that there was less CPU logic and power consumption, thus it was more efficient.

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for these 2 programs.
Justify your statistics.

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for these 2 programs.
Explain any differences.
